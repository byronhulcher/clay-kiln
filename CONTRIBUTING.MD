Contributing
============

If you have a plugin, behavior, validator, or other functionality that you believe is generic enough and would improve the lives of others, please submit an issue or better yet, pull request! We want to avoid enforcing workflows on Kiln users, but we welcome more efficient ways to working with different types of content and use-cases.

## Other Ways to Contribute

- submit bug reports
- submit ideas
- write documentation: Did you struggle with a bug but managed to fix it yourself and learn something about `Kiln` in the process? Write documentation about it! Either write it in a Markdown file or submit an `idea` issue, if you want to contribute to the wiki.

## Notes on Documentation
We're trying to create two kinds of documentation: *reference* and *narrative* documentation. Reference documentation are for developers with familiarity with `Kiln` and need to look up something specific, like what API calls are available. Narrative documentation are walkthroughs or tell a story about how to implement functionality.
